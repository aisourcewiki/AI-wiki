<p><strong>VAE</strong> - stands for variational autoencoder and is a component of the “diffusion model”. For model training, used to compress images into the latent space to speed up the training process for the diffusion model. Also used to decode images during inference (<a href="https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-stable-diffusion/">source</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.10752.pdf">source</a>)</p>
<p><strong>UNet</strong> - a component of the “diffusion model”. Helps to gradually remove noise from the initial noisy image to produce the final output (<a href="https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-stable-diffusion/">source</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Dreambooth - </strong>a method used to fine tune text-to-image models. <strong>(clarify)</strong></p>
<p><strong>EMA </strong>- exponential moving average, a technique used to improve inference performance and reduce the risk of "last-iterations overfitting" by taking the average of weights over a final period. Should be used only for inference, resuming model training (and perhaps fine tuning) should occur on the final (not averaged) weights (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/ucflc2/d_understanding_the_use_of_ema_in_diffusion_models/">source</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/x5am4v/ema_model_vs_non_ema_differences/">source</a>, <a href="https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-1/discussions/22">source)</a></p>
