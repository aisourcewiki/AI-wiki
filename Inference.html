<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>Model inference refers to the process of using a trained machine learning model to make predictions or decision on new input data, where data can be text, images, or numerical data depends on the task being performed by the model.&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Purpose of model inference</h1>
<p>Inference can take place in a variety of locations, from small mobile devices to large-scale cloud-based services. The performance of the inference is critical to the performance of overall machine learning application in terms of simplicity, scalability, and flexibility. Recently, a number of tools have surfaced that enable Machine Learning Scientists to swiftly and effortlessly deploy models, making their models more accessible to a wider range of users. Here, instead of introducing production-ready model inference techniques, we are going to introduce two alternatives for creating interactive user interfaces for machine learning model: Gradio and Streamlit.</p>
<h2>Gradio</h2>
<p>Gradio is a powerful web-based tool that allows users to quickly create UI component for machine learning models. It has a simple syntax and is easy to set up, and can be installed directly via pip. It uses a Python package that is compatible with many machine learning frameworks, such as Pytorch and TensorFlow. Unlike other packages, Gradio can be run within a Jupyter notebook. It is now widely used in companies like Amazon and Cisco, and academic institution like Stanford Medicine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, although Gradio has good documentation on the official website, it can be hard to find examples of specific features. Additionally, Gradio is great for building UI component but less so for creating web interfaces and dashboards for machine learning models.</p>
<p>Examples of How to deploy models using Gradio can be found in these Medium articles (<a href="https://medium.com/@IAmxIAo/inference-of-stable-diffusion-model-with-amazon-sagemaker-endpoint-and-gradio-5166b1ea32f9">Article 1</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/mobius-labs/how-ai-will-revolutionize-the-retail-fashion-industry-e4f145f1a629">Article 2</a>).</p>
<h2>Streamlit</h2>
<p>Streamlit, similar to Gradio, is another popular tool used to create web application for machine learning models and data visualizations. It provides an easy-to-use API for building app with Python and is compatible with many major libraries such as OpenCV, Latex, PyTorch, NumPy, Vega-Lit, and more. It is built on the top of several other frameworks, including Flask, Tornado, and ReactJS. Streamlit is also widely among large companies like Google and Uber.</p>
<p>Although it is not difficult to learn, it does requires some time to learn its own syntax. It has limited support for video and animation and unlike Gradio, it doesn't integrate with Jupyter Notebook/ Google Colab.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, Gradio and Streamlit are both excellent tools for easily and quickly creating web interfaces for machine learning models without needing any technical expertise.</p>
